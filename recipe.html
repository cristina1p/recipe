    <ul>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>soy milk</li>
        <li>banana</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>First, whisk together the dry ingredients in a large bowl – flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.</li>
        <li>Pour in the non-dairy milk, water and oil.</li>
        <li>Stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; mix them too much and the pancakes will be dense.</li>
        <li>Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with a little vegan butter or coconut oil and drop about 1/3 cup pancake batter onto the pan. Cook until bubbles form, flip and cook for another minute.</li>
